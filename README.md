# Computer Vision Project with OpenCV

This repository contains implementations of three key computer vision algorithms using OpenCV in Python:

### 1. SIFT Keypoint Detection and Matching
Detects keypoints using the SIFT algorithm and matches them using a brute-force matcher with a ratio test. The result shows correspondences between two images.


### 2. RANSAC for Outlier Removal
Applies RANSAC to filter out incorrect matches from SIFT and estimates a homography (perspective transformation) between two images.


### 3. Harris Corner Detection
Detects corner points in a grayscale image using the Harris algorithm and visualizes them in red.
